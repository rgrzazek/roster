# Roster
#### Calendar to display 5/5/10 roster

This calendar / roster renderer is for the benefit of people working a roster of 5 days, 5 nights
and 10 days off.

## Execution
Open the calendar at rgrzazek.github.io/roster and select from up to four different alignments
of the roster that coincide with my workplace by pressing the "Different crew" button.

When you're on the right roster, navigate through the months with the next and previous buttons
to see what days you are scheduled to work.

## Support
I am not providing support at this stage, but I intend to increase the scope to handle
any cyclical roster.
